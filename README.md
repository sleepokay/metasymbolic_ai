# Metasymbolic AI

## Overview
Metasymbolic AI is an experiment to synthesize neural networks and symbolic AI by developing a framework where symbols and their relations emerge dynamically from neural activations across multiple scales, with the hope of improving computational efficiency, transfer learning, and cross-domain reasoning.

Metasymbolic AI differs from traditional neurosymbolic approaches by:
1. Focusing on symbols that emerge dynamically from activations
2. Implementing multi-scale relations between symbols
3. Prioritizing computational efficiency through symbol reuse
4. Developing symbol-guided attention mechanisms

## Core Concepts
- **Emergent Symbols**: Dynamic symbol formation as statistical attractor basins in activation space 
- **Multi-Scale Relations**: Connections between symbols at different levels of abstraction
- **Computational Efficiency**: Reuse of relational patterns and bypassing of computation through symbolic shortcuts
- **Symbol-Guided Processing**: Use of symbolic structures to guide neural computation

## Project Status
- Proof-of-concept implementation using GMMs and T5
- Initial testing on mathematical reasoning tasks
- Ongoing development of cross-scale symbolic relations
- Performance evaluation framework established

The proof-of-concept implementation uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify emergent symbols in transformer activations, with T5 as the base model. The implementation focuses on demonstrating measurable efficiency gains and basic transfer learning improvements.

### Research Goals
- Demonstrate comparable performance against baseline T5 model with fewer compute resources
- Improve sample efficiency in transfer learning scenarios
- Provide better interpretability through symbolic structures
- Create a cognitive architecture inspired by human concept formation

### Next Steps
- Expand testing to more complex reasoning tasks
- Refine symbol management algorithms
- Develop more sophisticated cross-scale interactions
- Measure and optimize transfer learning efficiency
