# Metasymbolic AI

## Overview
Metasymbolic AI is an experiment to synthesize neural networks and symbolic AI by developing a framework where symbols and their relations emerge dynamically from neural activations across multiple scales, with the hope of improving computational efficiency, transfer learning, and cross-domain reasoning.

Metasymbolic AI differs from traditional neurosymbolic approaches by:
1. Focusing on symbols that emerge dynamically from activations
2. Implementing multi-scale relations between symbols
3. Prioritizing computational efficiency through symbol reuse
4. Developing symbol-guided attention mechanisms

## Core Concepts
- **Emergent Symbols**: Dynamic symbol formation as statistical attractor basins in activation space 
- **Multi-Scale Relations**: Connections between symbols at different levels of abstraction
- **Computational Efficiency**: Reuse of relational patterns and bypassing of computation through symbolic shortcuts
- **Symbol-Guided Processing**: Use of symbolic structures to guide neural computation

## Current Project Status
The proof-of-concept uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to create symbols from underlying transformer activations, with T5 as the base model. The implementation focuses on demonstrating feasibility and assessing possible efficiency gains and transfer learning improvements from symbolic reuse.

### Next Steps
- Expand testing to more complex reasoning tasks
- Implement energy mechanics for symbol space evolution
- Develop more sophisticated cross-scale interactions
- Measure and optimize transfer learning efficiency (if any)
